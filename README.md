Framework for evaluating soccer player's pass selection

Using data from statsbomb.com that has been made public and the code from Devin Pleuler's applied-example repository I demonstrate a possible framework for evaluating players passing iq in the 2018 world cup based off their pass selection.

Thanks to statsbomb for making the data public and to Devin Pleuler for his repository detailing a method for finding pass difficulty.
